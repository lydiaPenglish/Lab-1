**Building a Book**
We are knitting a copy of Hadley Wickham's book Advanced R Programming from the github [repo](https://github.com/hadley/adv-r) but have come across the following error in the Rcpp.Rmd document:

`Line 77 Error in sourceCpp(code = code, env = env, rebuild = rebuild, cacheDir = cacheDir, : Error 1 occured building shared library. Calls: local ... withVisible -> eval -> eval -> cppFunction -> sourceCpp`

If we navigate to line 77 in the Rcpp.Rmd document we find the following script:

```{r add, eval=FALSE}
cppFunction('int add(int x, int y, int z) {
  int sum = x + y + z;
  return sum;
}')
# add works like a regular R function
add
add(1, 2, 3)
```

We've tried downloading and updating Rtools and making sure other packages were updated but this was unsuccessful. However another group member was succesfully able to knit the .html file.
