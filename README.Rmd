#1. Document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)
There were many packages that needed to be installed to knit the index.Rmd. The first problem that we have ran into was that the *emo* package was not available from usual CRAN repository. Another issue came with an error message: *In system(cmd) : 'make' not found*

#2. Describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work)
Instead of install this package from the CRAN, we installed this package through hadley's github. Using *devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")*, we could successfully install the package.
